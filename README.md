Title:
[PREANN][FORK] CRowdcoinCLassic[CRCL]  - Neoscrypt, MN, POW, POS**. No ICO, No premine***, No instamine. More to come..

** The idea is to implement POS at some point following the best practices to complete and secure the ecosystem.
*** There is a 200 000 premine left in the original blockchain but it cannot be accessed until next year. The matter will be investigated further.

Summary:
Enough is enough. After continuously watching the slow degradation of the Crowdcoin project for the past few months(not to mention the price), a decision was made to support the current blockchain and Neoscrypt algo. To do so a fork has to be done - a snapshot was taken at 12.11.18 17:34 UTC.

Quick roadmap:
1. Manifesto first. Then Whitepaper to explain the project deeper. And Yellowpaper after that, filled with technical stuff to explain it further. 
2. Almost nothing has to be changed at first - nor code, nor pools settings: 
 - a new wallets has to be compiled with a few things replaced.;
 - puting some nodes online to support the blockchain (or using pools if any); 
 - a manual with explanation how to mine to a wallet (local or remote).
3. An explorer has to be started using some scripts available.
4. Complete the assessment of the project. 
5. Moving to POW/POS/MN code.
6. MVP: A portal for learning and crowdfunding (the original project idea), created using some particular social software available right now. Implementing gamification instead of airdrops and using CRCL as an utility coin only.
- There will be no real coins keeped on the site, an quantities only. They will be stored in account(s) on an exchange.
- KYC through third-party company.  
7. Complete code audit by a third-party company.
8. Go to the Moon. :)

The projects will be supported by donations at first (an address will be generated to donate directly or by pointing a miner) then with small dev fee in every block generated.

The manifesto will come to light soon to explain the intentions further.

It will be an anonymous effort until the support for this project get stronger.

P.S. It may smell fishy right now but it will get better in time, this is a promise. And you know to always DYOR, right.
